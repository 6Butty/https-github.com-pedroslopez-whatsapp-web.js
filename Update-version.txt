Keep Your Fork Up-to-Date:
    Periodically, you should sync your fork with the original repository to get the latest updates. To do this, run the following commands:
        git fetch upstream
        git checkout main
        git merge upstream/main
    This will update your fork's main branch with changes from the original repository.

Push Your Changes:
    Whenever you have new custom changes or want to sync with the original repository, push your changes to your fork:
        git push origin my-custom-changes
